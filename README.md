# pytorch_practise
This repo has colab notebooks, Jupyter Notebooks and python files which contains pytorch code for deep learning.
# At its core, PyTorch is a library for processing tensors.

## Tensor
<li>
You will represent the data using tensors. Tensors are a generalization of matrices: for example, a stack of three matrices with the amounts of red, green, and blue at different locations in a 64 x 64 pixel image is a tensor with the shape 3 x 64 x 64.
